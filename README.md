# about-me
I was born and raised in Jenkintown, PA, a tiny suburb just outside of Philadelphia, and attended High School at Jenkintown High School. During my years at Jenkintown I was deeply involved in athletics earning numerous accolades in Cross Country, Baseball, and Track, as well as serving on the Athletic Advisory Committee. Other organizations that I was a part of include National Honor Society and World Language Honor Society.

I am now a freshman at Allegheny College in Meadville, PA, and am on the Varsity Cross Country and Track teams. I have yet to declare a major and minor, but have great interest in both the Computer Science and Economics fields, and plan on combing the two somehow, however; for the moment I am simply testing the waters with introductory courses in both fields.
